## HTTP Status Codes Library

This repository provides a comprehensive list of HTTP status codes and their descriptions, organized for use in various programming languages. Each status code is paired with its corresponding message to provide clear, human-readable context.

### Purpose

The purpose of this library is to offer a convenient and readable way to handle HTTP status codes within your application, regardless of the programming language. By using named constants or enums for status codes and their descriptions, it helps to avoid the use of "magic numbers" and improves code maintainability and clarity.

### Usage

You can utilize this library to:

- Simplify the handling of HTTP responses by using descriptive constants or enums instead of numerical codes.
- Improve code readability and maintainability by replacing magic numbers with meaningful names.
- Provide consistent and clear responses in your APIs.
